🧩 PDF Maker & Merger (Flask Web App)

A simple Flask web app that lets you merge PDFs and create new PDFs online.

🛠️ Features

📂 Merge multiple PDF files into one

📝 Create new PDFs from user input

🧠 Simple and clean interface using Flask templates

⚡ Fast and minimal — built for learning, not hype

💬 About This Project

I’m currently learning Flask and building small practical tools to master:

Backend routes

File upload & handling

Templating (Jinja2)
